                Sydney seems taken aback by your question: he'd prefer not to disclose
                that sort of thing to a stranger. Maybe you can win back his heart! Do you...

                      Apologise for being so direct and steer the conversation
                      towards video games

                      Ask him why he doesn't want to talk about it.
                      What's wrong Sydney? Am I not good enough for you??
