# Sparta Core Project 1: DATE NIGHT


## Purpose
This is a **text adventure** game developed with HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. The main purpose of the game is to help its users detect and assess different social cues in the complex configurations produced during the course of a date; in addition, the game also serves a comedic purpose. In the future, I would like to make a similar game for autistic people with the aim of helping them to pick up on social cues and become more emotionally intelligent.

## Functionality
**DATE NIGHT** is a simple application that shows the user various different scenarios: the course of the game's story changes depending on the user's reaction to a given scenario. The various reactions are displayed as buttons which, when clicked, transport the user to a subsequent part of the date. To do this, I used vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the elements of the DOM belonging to the buttons.

## Implementation

The functionality has been implemented using the following features:

* Twitter Bootstrap 3.7
* Javascript
* semantic HTML5
* CSS3
* responsive web development/design where possible
* game sound bites from zapsplat.com and playonloop.com
* game sprites from buildnewgames.com
* 8 bit font from fontspace.com

## How to Run
* Open the terminal
* Clone this repository to your machine by running the command ```git clone https://github.com/Evie-Skinner18/project-one.git ```
* Open project-one/index.html in your web browser

## Known Issues
* The audio does not work in Chrome because Chrome does not allow audio to be played automatically (it must be triggered by user input). For best results, please play the game in Safari.
* The game has been developed using functional Javascript rather than an OOP approach.
